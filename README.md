the file "search1" is from OMDB API , and "search2" is from TMDB.               
In the OMDB API Page of this project I have added a rating ability and users can access what they have Rated on Page "Reviews"                                                        
The navbar :                                              
Reviews is linked to a page that shows what movies and how many stars you have Rated(same as Your rated Movies button in the first page).                                    
Movies is linked to the first page (index.html) and it allows user to choose what they want to do,                                                 
1-search and discover what movie they are looking for (Discover movies button)                                                       
2-they know which year it has been released and want to rate it or see more details about it(by Name and year Button).                                      
Rating movie is only available in the (by Name and year page "search1.html")
